<b>Command</b>                                               Description
docker pull image                            pulls an image from dockerhub
docker images                                shows all the images the machine
docker ps                                    shows all the running container
docker ps -a                                 shows all the containers including stopped containers
docker run image                             creates a container from an image
docker stop <container id/container image>   stops a running container
docker system prune -f                       To remove all the stopped continers (docker does not touch the running contianer)
docker system prune -a                       To remove all the stopped containers + unused images
docker run -d                                To run the container in the background
docker run -i                                To attach standard input to container
docker run -t                                To attach standard output to container
docker run --name                            To assign give name to container
docker run --entrypoint                      Entry point is the command to be executed once a container is created.
                                             An image might have an entrypoint already, this option overrides the container's entrypoint
docker run -v                                To map a volume on the host to container
docker run --network                         Assigns the docker created network to docker containers
docker run -p                                To map a port of the host to container

Docker run command creates a brand new container each time you run the command.
If a user has to make changes, then do the changes and create an image and store that image and then run that image.
